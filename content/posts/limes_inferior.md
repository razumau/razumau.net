Janusz Zajdel’s [*Limes Inferior*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2108205.Limes_inferior) is an allegory and satire of Soviet Poland with a 200-page setup. 

In the not-too-distant future, everyone on Earth lives in large cities. Food and necessities are produced by machines (thanks to an unexpected leap in energy production), but there are still some jobs to be done. To fill those jobs fairly, after getting their free education people are split into seven classes from 0 to 6 according to their test results, and only 0s, 1s, 2s, and some 3s have to do something. It’s not full communism, so the higher your class, the better is your compensation, and non-working classes just receive basic income.

Sneer, the main character, is a lifter in a city called Argoland. He illegally helps other people to pass tests for a higher class (the only occasion described in the novel simply has him dictating answers via an earbud) and is a fake 4. In the first half of the novel he’s mostly wandering around the city and bumping into other criminals.

Which is a bad thing, because it gives Zajdel an opportunity to talk about various types of possible crimes in excruciating detail. Your life in Argoland is built around a Key—a smart ID card linked to your bank account and your biometrics—so there’s a lot of Key-related fraud. It’s hard not to notice that a lot of these security holes wouldn’t be difficult to close (one subplot revolves around a Key that can spend money without limits because most transactions aren’t validated on the bank server).

Sneer doesn’t think much about this until he meets mysterious Alicja who gives him shelter (after his Key is lost), some hints about learning the truth about Argoland, a bracelet, and romantic longing. Wearing a bracelet mysteriously makes you super-strong (although Sneer uses it only once—to beat up two guys who tried stealing both fingerprints and a Key from Sneer’s colleague), and hints mysteriously become a fulfilled prophecy. 

A man from the government appears and tells Sneer that they know he’s really a 0 and a lifter, but that’s okay, how about a job where you spy on a science institute for us? Sneer likes the money and agrees, only to find out that the institute is quite a sham: instead of designing new features for the Keys, scientists are studying them as alien objects and producing a lot of silly papers. However, later he breaks into a director’s safe and finds a lot of useful research on various ways to break the Key, including the aforementioned limitless one. 

All this Key Institute stuff is just a test, so after passing it Sneer is invited to the real government’s office. It’s just outside the city, which marks the first time he leaves Argoland (you *may* leave the city if you get special permission to travel to another one, but why would you, they’re all the same). So now the big boss can tell Sneer the truth.

And the truth is aliens. Aliens came to Earth, gifted some knowledge on energy and automation, and then made all the governments transform into a collection of identical cities with classes, keys, and occasional chemicals in food to make people more stupid. Nothing personal, it’s just that they are fanatics and think that everyone should live like this. Aliens are too strong to fight them, so the only thing that can be done is working in for this government and hoping for the best. Oh, and we can ignore lifters and such because aliens either don’t know about them or don’t care. 

Depressed Sneer goes to his newly-acquired quite luxurious (compared to everything in Argoland) apartment for the final scene: a mysterious vision of Alicja leading him to a door into the inner world, where aliens have no power.

Janusz Zajdel died in 1985, with aliens still in Argoland.
